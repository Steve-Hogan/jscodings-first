Unique Color Shirt. <br>
Prepbuddy is very tasteful of clothes. 
He has N numbers of shirts hanging in the hanger in his wardrobe.
Prepbuddy likes to wear different colored clothes. So, whenever he see there are two or more shirts with the same color,
he removes all the shirt of that color from his wardrobe. 
Now, he wants to know how many M unique color shirts are left in the wardrobe.Prepbuddy wants you to find M. <br>


Note: As there are many shades of a color so consider integers as a color name. <br>
i.e, color of shirt is 0,1,2, â€¦ , N. <br>

Min and Max. <br>
Congratulations on making up to this question. Let us give you a fairly simple array problem to solve. 
If you know how to iterate through the array, you will easily be able to solve this.
The problem statement is simple- given N elements, find the minimum and maximum numbers among those elements. <br>

Input format <br>
The first line contains test case T denoting the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines,
First-line contains N representing the length of the array.The second line contains N space-separated integers. <br>

Output format <br>
For each test case on a new line, return minimum and maximum elements. <br>

<pre>
  function arrayMin(arr) {
    let min = (Math.min(...arr));
      return min;
  }
  
  function arrayMax(arr) {
    let max = (Math.max(...arr));

Birthday Game. <br>
Yatharth and Anamika are playing a game.
Anamika loves Yatharth very much and she wants to share a chocolate bar with him in which each of the squares consists of an integer represented by A[i]. 
She decides to share a contiguous segment of the chocolate bar selected such that the length of the segment matches Yatharth's birth month 
M and the sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birthday D. 
You must determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate. <br>
Input Format <br>
The first line consists of an integer N which denotes the number of squares in the chocolate bar.       
The second line consists of N space-separated integers A[i], consisting of numbers on the chocolate bar squares.        
The third line contains an integer D and M which denotes Yatharth's birthday and his birth month respectively.  <br>    
Output Format <br>
Print an integer denoting the total number of ways that Anamika can partition her chocolate bar to share with Yatharth. <br>
